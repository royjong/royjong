### MY ROAD TO BECOMING A FULLSTACK DEVELOPER THROUGH EXPERIENCE.  
ðŸ‘‹  I try to focus all my time and effort in Javascript and Python. 
- ðŸ‘€ I stopped with college to focus mainly on building more experience as a fullstack developer. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focussing my time on the MERN stack, because I simply love ES6 and building things with Javascript.
